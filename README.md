# How It's Made:
Tech used:

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

What a fun, learning project! Seriously. I made it possible to dynamically create your books via popup form > add the title > distribute the data to an additional popup.
You can also delete the book from the Library. This is not only backend, but frontend UI. Having the backend array and UI play together nicely took some time, but I learned what's best.

# Lessons Learned:
I learned/furthered a lot here that includes the below and more:

* regex on text
* continue/break
* constructors
* manipulating arrays
* utilizing and manipulating forms
* creating elements and attaching them
* adjusting element properties (class, styles, text, etc)
* utilizing eventListeners to transform the above
